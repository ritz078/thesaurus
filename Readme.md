> Thesaurus helps in finding synonyms of any word including suggestion from other languages.

#### Why?
There are so many thesaurus on the web. But I wanted something which also shows alternatives from other languages when I was searching for a domain name. Since I needed it, I made this and am open sourcing for everyone.
